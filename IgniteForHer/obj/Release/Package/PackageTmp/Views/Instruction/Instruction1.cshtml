<h4>Chapter 1: What are Variables? </h4>
<p>You’re planning a graduation party and it’s time to choose the items for the party. </p>
<p>Choose the DJ, the music, the food, and the guests. The image on the far right shows you some examples we put in place. Find your own Vines or Pictures to design the ultimate party! </p>
<p>When you have found the perfect image of decorations, for your party replace the URL of the example balloons (http://www.tikiballoons.com/images/animatedballoons.gif) and replace it with the URL to the decorations you have chosen for your party. Once you make your changes, click the Submit button to see how your code changes update the party setup!</p>
<p>What this means in code? You're storing your pictures or data in a variable (var) that will be used to specify or define each important aspect of your party.  Continue to update each variable with the perfect item for your party and click the Submit button after each update to see the party evolve.</p>
<p>When you get to the dancers variable, you are creating an Object. An object can contains multiple items (variables). In this case, the first variable ("top") is the image of dancers along the top, the second variable ("bottom") is the dancer on the bottom. Update those now, then click Submit and you will be done defining the items in your party!</p>
<p>After you finish defining the items in your party, click the next button to move onto the next chapter where you will design the layout of your party.</p>
